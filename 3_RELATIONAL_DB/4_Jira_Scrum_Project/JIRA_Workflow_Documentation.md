# 🧭 JIRA Workflow — Setup From Scratch

This document explains **how I created my Jira Scrum workflow from the very beginning**, step by step, for the **FullStack_CollegeProject**.

---

## 🚀 Step 1 — Creating the Jira Space

To begin, I created a brand-new Jira project:

1. Logged into Jira.
2. Clicked **Create project**.
3. Selected the **Scrum – Team-managed** template.
4. Named the project:

```

FullStack_CollegeProject

```

5. Jira automatically assigned the project key:

```

SCRUM

```

6. The project opened with default views:

   * Backlog
   * Board
   * Timeline
   * Forms

This gave me a clean starting environment to build my Agile workflow.

---

## 🛠 Step 2 — Configuring Work Types

Inside **Project Settings**, I enabled the work types that I needed:

### ✔ Enabled:

* **Epic**
* **Task**
* **Subtask**

### ❌ Not used:

* Story (not required for this course)
* Bugs (no bug tracking needed)
* Labels (optional; I left them empty)

This simplified structure makes the board clean and easy to manage.

---

## 🧩 Step 3 — Creating the Main Epics

Next, I created the four Epics that represent the **modules of the FullStack course**.

In the Backlog, I opened the **Epic Panel** and clicked **+ Create epic**.

### Epics Created:

* 🟣 **Web Technologies Module**
* 🟢 **Relational Databases Module**
* 🔵 **Testing Technologies Module**
* 🔴 **Final Integrated App / Portfolio**

Each Epic groups tasks for a specific module of the course.

---

## 📅 Step 4 — Creating the First Sprint

In the Backlog, I clicked **Create sprint** and defined:

### Sprint:

```

FSCP Sprint 1
Duration: 1 December – 7 December

```

This sprint contains the first tasks I need to complete for the project.

I did not use Sprint 0 (optional placeholder).

---

## 🧱 Step 5 — Building the Backlog

With the Sprint and Epics ready, I began creating the initial tasks.

I used the **Create** button and filled:

* Task Summary  
* Description  
* Epic (linked)  
* Sprint (assigned)  
* Status (To Do)  

Example tasks:

### ✔ SCRUM-9 — Set up FullStack folder structure in VSCode

Epic: Web Technologies Module  
Sprint: FSCP Sprint 1

### ✔ SCRUM-10 — Build PHP CRUD pages

Epic: Web Technologies Module  
Sprint: FSCP Sprint 1

Tasks appear immediately in the Backlog under the correct Sprint.

---

## 🧭 Step 6 — Organizing Tasks Into Sprints

I dragged each task from the Backlog into:

```

FSCP Sprint 1

```

This created a clean structure where the sprint contains only the work I plan to do this week.

---

## 📊 Step 7 — Understanding the Board View

My board is automatically created with three standard columns:

* **To Do**
* **In Progress**
* **Done**

Tasks move across these columns during development.  
This matches the Scrum workflow used in class.

---

## 🕒 Step 8 — Enabling Timeline (Optional)

I turned on the **Timeline** from:

```

Board settings → Timeline → Enable

```

This shows:

* Epics as long-term bars  
* Tasks as child items  
* Dependencies across weeks  

Useful for planning and visual tracking.

---

## 🖼 Step 9 — Capturing Evidence

Inside the folder:

```

4_Jira_Scrum_Project/JIRA_Evidence

```

I store screenshots such as:

* Epic Panel  
* Backlog with Sprints  
* Sprint 1  
* Task detail panel  
* Board view  

These are required as evidence for coursework.

---

## 🧠 Step 10 — Reflection

Through this Jira workflow, I learned:

* How to structure a Scrum project  
* How Epics organize large bodies of work  
* How Sprints control development speed  
* How Backlog and Board support daily task management  
* How Jira simplifies project tracking in education and industry  

This setup mirrors professional Agile team practices.

---

## 📌 Status

This Jira setup is **complete**.  
Tasks will continue to be added throughout the development of the FullStack project.
