# Lessons Learned – FastBurgersNow Database Project

## 📌 What I Learned About ERD Design
(Write about identifying entities, relationships, primary keys, many-to-many junction tables.)

## 📌 What I Learned About SQL (DDL & DML)
(Explain how you created tables, fixed FK problems, and tested inserts.)

## 📌 Challenges I Encountered
(Example: 'order' keyword issues, foreign key ordering, phpMyAdmin import errors.)

## 📌 How I Solved Those Challenges
(Example: using backticks, ordering tables, using combined SQL scripts.)

## 📌 What I Would Do Differently Next Time
(Example: start with combined SQL script sooner, draw ERD earlier.)
